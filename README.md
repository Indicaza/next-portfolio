- **TypeScript**: Static typing for better code quality.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework.
- **Docker**: Containerized development and production environments.
- **MongoDB**: Integrated database with Dockerized setup.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables

This project uses two environment files:

- `.env` (default shared variables):
  ```env
  MONGODB_URI=mongodb://mongo:27017/mydatabase
  NODE_ENV=development
  ```
- `.env.local` (local development overrides, ignored in production):
  ```env
  MONGODB_URI=mongodb://root:example@mongo:27017/mydatabase
  ```

### 2. Development

Run the following to start the project in development mode:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will:

- Start the Next.js development server at `http://localhost:3000`.
- Start MongoDB on `mongodb://localhost:27017`.

To stop the containers:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

### 3. Production

To build and serve the app in production:

1. Build the app:
   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```
2. Run the production container:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up
   ```
